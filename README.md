***by Franco Maldonado*** <br>
This is part of Google Data Analytics Netflix Data: Cleaning, Analysis and Visualization and this workbook has been created to document the entire process of data analysis, cleansing and visualization, and to show the skills and tools to be used.

# **Project background**
Netflix is a popular streaming service that offers a vast catalog of movies, TV shows, and original contents. This dataset is a cleaned version of the original version which can be found here. The data consist of contents added to Netflix from 2008 to 2021. The oldest content is as old as 1925 and the newest as 2021. This dataset will be cleaned, vizualized and anlyzed with Python. The purpose of this dataset is to test my data cleaning and visualization skills.
